Project Title: N-Queens Teaching Backtracking

Abstract
Backtracking is an algorithmic approach  for solving constraint satisfaction problems that is often introduced to undergraduate computer science students in their third or fourth year of study.  This research aims to explore the effectiveness of 2D and 3D virtual learning environments for teaching backtracking.  In particular, this project developed 2D and 3D environments to solve the variations of the n-queens problem.  The n-queens problem is a constraint satisfaction problem in which … 
In the virtual learning environments, the user interacts with the board by clicking on tiles to place the queens.  The board provides feedback, highlighting all threatened tiles green and highlighting a queen’s tile red if it is threatened by another queen, signifying that the solution is invalid.The 2D environment features an interactive board for finding a solution to the initial n-queens problem, which then progresses to five boards to allow the user to apply the same backtracking concepts to solve a 3-dimensional version of the n-queens problem, the n2 queens problem.  The application’s responsive features provide the necessary context to understand how queens threaten each other on different boards.
The 3D environment features a board for the n-queens problem, and functions very similarly to the 2D environment.  However, when it progresses to the five boards scenario, the 3D environment displays them stacked atop each other.   The user can select a board to place queens on by clicking the board, which moves it out beside the stack and allows the user to begin placing queens on it.   This visualization allows users to understand the way queens threaten on other boards intuitively.
The plan is to evaluate the effectiveness of the learning environments as a tool for teaching backtracking in an experiment with undergraduate students in the Spring 2024. The results from deploying this application will help illuminate the use of a 2D and 3D environment effects learning, and how it might impact the students’ understanding of backtracking and recursion.
